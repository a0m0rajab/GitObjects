### GitObjects

The aim of this project is to access the objects in any Git repository from within Java.

There are only two source files -- explained in [the API](https://maeyler.github.io/GitObjects/)

Start with `$ java -jar sss.jar` and click on `Menu.chooser()` and then on `Chooser.runTeacher()`

Select GitInspector.txt in the File dialog and then select Git.class -- Here is the explanation of the events:

We need a new Git instance in the current directory: `G = new Git()`

First, display All Branches in G:  `G.getAllBranches()`

![tree branches](images/branches.JPG)

There are 13 branches in our repo. Find the HEAD branch in G:  `h = G.currentHEAD()`

Display All Commits in this branch:  `h.getAllCommits()`

HEAD branch has 21 commits in this repo

Find the last commit in h:  `c = h.getLatestCommit()`  This is a Git object of the first kind.

This object has all the information about the commit: 
* what: SHA and pointer to the Tree (contents)
* when: time in msec and as date string
* after: the parents (0, 1, or 2 SHA links)
* who: the author (name and e-mail)

Every Git object has also 5 pieces of information:
* Type: commit, tree, or blob (=binary file)
* SHA serves as a content-dependent name
* Human-readable name, need not be unique
* Size in bytes (uncompressed binary)
* Parent object -- either commit or tree

![latest commit](images/latest%20commit.PNG)

Load the tree of this Commit:  `t = c.getTree()`  This is a Git object of the second kind: the root directory.

Get the first child in the tree:  `b = t.getChildAt(0)`  This is a Git object of the third kind: a file.

Finally, display the tree:  `Menu.toTree(t);`

### Earlier Work

#### V0. GitObjects.java

It all started with [an excellent article](https://hackernoon.com/https-medium-com-zspajich-understanding-git-data-model-95eb16cc99f5) on .git/objects -- I had to try it myself!

It worked fine, but the story is incomplete: Most Git objects are packed!


### V1. GitInspector becomes Git.java

Rather than trying to unpack objects, Git should do the work -- use `java.lang.ProcessBuilder` 

**Usage:** Compile and run Git.java at the root of any Git repo
